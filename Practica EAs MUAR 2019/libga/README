IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------

   Please see the file `LICENCE' for important licensing information.

   Any bug reports, suggested improvements, and complaints are welcomed and
   will be incorporated into future versions of LibGA.

   As is usual, the user manual has not yet been written...   ;-)

   LibGA has been run successfully on the following systems:

                         Sun SparcStations
                         Apollo workstations
                         PC clones
                         NeXT
                         Amiga

   If you port LibGA to other systems, please let me know.


HOW TO MAKE THE SOURCE:
----------------------

   Make sure you are in the `libga100' directory.  Then just type `make' for
   the Unix version or `make -fmakefile.tc' for the DOS version.

   Run ga-test to be sure everything is working OK.  

   Parameters can be changed in ga-test.cfg without the need to recompile.

   If you have any problems, don't hesitate to contact me.
